WCAG Contrast Checker library
=============================

Usage
-----

:download:`View keyword documentation <contrastchecker.html>`.

Include keywords with::

   Resource  Accessibility/contrastchecker.robot

.. note::

   Currently all keywords are written as user keywords, but later they may be
   refactored into Python-keywords. If this happens, there will be backwards
   compatible wrappers available at ``contrastchecker.robot``.
