WAVE Toolbar library
====================

Usage
-----

:download:`View keyword documentation <wavetoolbar.html>`.

Include keywords with::

   Resource  Accessibility/wavetoolbar.robot

.. note::

   Currently all keywords are written as user keywords, but later they may be
   refactored into Python-keywords. If this happens, there will be backwards
   compatible wrappers available at ``wavetoolbar.robot``.
